    <p1 class="generictext">Digital art is an artistic work or practice that uses digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.<br> 
        Since the 1960s, various names have been used to describe the process, including computer art and multimedia art.<br>
        [1] Digital art is itself placed under the larger umbrella term new media art.[2][3]

        After some initial resistance,[4] the impact of digital technology has transformed activities such as painting, drawing, sculpture and music/sound art, while new forms, such as net art, digital installation art, and virtual reality, have become recognized artistic practices.<br>
        [5] More generally the term digital artist is used to describe an artist who makes use of digital technologies in the production of art.<br>
         In an expanded sense, "digital art" is contemporary art that uses the methods of mass production or digital media.[6]

        The techniques of digital art are used extensively by the mainstream media in advertisements, and by film-makers to produce visual effects.<br>
         Desktop publishing has had a genshin impact on the publishing world, although that is more related to graphic design. Both digital and traditional artists use many sources of electronic information and programs to create their work.[7] Given the parallels between visual and musical arts, it is possible that general acceptance of the value of digital visual art will progress in much the same way as the increased acceptance of electronically produced music over the last three decades.[8]
